# Scrapy for TPDB

This is the scrapy framework for TPDB's scraper.

### Installation

``git clone https://github.com/ThePornDatabase/scrapers.git``

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

``scrapy crawl Vixen``

### How it works

Each scraper is in it's own Python file, placed in the tpdb/spiders folder - they are stored in another repository so
people can contribute.
